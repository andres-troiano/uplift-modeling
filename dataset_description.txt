Data description

This dataset is constructed by assembling data resulting from several incrementality tests, a particular randomized trial procedure where a random part of the population is prevented from being targeted by advertising. it consists of 25M rows, each one representing a user with 11 features, a treatment indicator and 2 labels (visits and conversions).

Fields

Here is a detailed description of the fields (they are comma-separated in the file):

    f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11: feature values (dense, float)
    treatment: treatment group (1 = treated, 0 = control)
    conversion: whether a conversion occured for this user (binary, label)
    visit: whether a visit occured for this user (binary, label)
    exposure: treatment effect, whether the user has been effectively exposed (binary)

Key figures

    Format: CSV
    Size: 459MB (compressed)
    Rows: 25,309,483
    Average Visit Rate: .04132
    Average Conversion Rate: .00229

Tasks

The dataset was collected and prepared with uplift prediction in mind as the main task. Additionally we can foresee related usages such as but not limited to:

    benchmark for causal inference
    uplift modeling
    interactions between features and treatment
    heterogeneity of treatment
    benchmark for observational causality methods
