**Project Title:** *Measuring the Incremental Impact of Marketing Campaigns with Causal Inference*

**Goal:**
Build an end-to-end data science project that uses **causal inference** methods to measure the true business impact of a marketing campaign. The project should demonstrate technical depth (classical + ML-based causal methods), strong business framing, and clean software engineering practices.

**Dataset:**

* Use the **Criteo Uplift Prediction Dataset** (publicly available).
* It contains randomized control vs treatment groups, user features, and conversion outcomes → perfect for uplift/causal analysis.

**Business Problem:**
Companies spend millions on marketing. A simple correlation may show a sales increase after ads, but the real question is: *“How much of that increase was actually caused by the campaign?”*
The goal is to estimate the **causal effect** (incremental conversions/revenue), identify which customer segments respond positively, and simulate how ROI could improve with smarter targeting.

**Methods to Implement:**

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

   * Compare treatment vs control groups.
   * Visualize biases, distributions, outcome differences.

2. **Classical Causal Inference:**

   * Propensity score matching or weighting.
   * Average Treatment Effect (ATE) estimation.
   * (Optional) Difference-in-Differences if you create a temporal version.

3. **Causal Machine Learning:**

   * Uplift modeling (T-Learner, X-Learner, Two-Model).
   * Causal forests (using libraries like `EconML` or `CausalML`).

4. **Evaluation:**

   * Compare uplift models vs naïve approaches.
   * Use metrics like Qini curves, uplift curves.

5. **Business Interpretation:**

   * Translate results into ROI: *“Targeting high-uplift segments would increase campaign efficiency by X%.”*
   * Show practical recommendations for marketers.

**Deliverables:**

* **Code:** Modular, reproducible scripts (notebooks + `src/` folder).
* **Documentation:** A polished `README.md` explaining business framing, dataset, methods, and results.
* **Visualization:** Plots showing uplift curves, treatment effects across segments.
* **Optional Deployment:** Simple dashboard (Plotly Dash or Streamlit) that lets a user explore treatment effects across demographics.

**Tech Stack:**

* Python 3.10+
* Libraries: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib/seaborn/plotly`, `EconML` or `CausalML`
* Repo structured for clarity:
